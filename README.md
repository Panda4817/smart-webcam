TensorFlow.js Smart Webcam
=================

A simple smart webcam that alerts users with sound when a cat or bird is spotted. 

Use-case: This could be used with an old smart phone, placed on a window sil looking out into the garden and alert users if animals are in the garden, where plants are being grown, thus avoid eaten/ruined plants.
